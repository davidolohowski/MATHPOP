The MATHPOP project is an `R` software developed to help astrophysicists infer globular cluster counts and their luminosity functions in Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies. This repo contains the source code and various analysis files for the MATHPOP project.

For more details, please see the [MATHPOP][] webpage for a simple tutorial and all `RMarkdown` files to reproduce the results in the original MATHPOP paper.

The main source code is contained in the `code/` folder. `data/` folder contains example data used in the MATHPOP paper and other post-inference data. `source/` folder contains old-version source code used to obtain results in the original paper.

For bugs report, trouble-shooting, or questions, please open an [issue][].

MATHPOP was developed, and is maintained by David Li, a Ph.D. candidate in the [Astrostatistics Research Team (ART)][] and the [Department of Statistical Sciences][] at [The University of Toronto][]. He is funded by the [Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute (CANSSI)][] under a [CANSSI Multi-disciplinary Doctoral Trainee Program][], and a [Doctoral Fellow][] in the [Data Sciences Institute (DSI)][].

An `R` package is currently under development, and will be made publicly available at this repo as well as CRAN upon publication of the original MATHPOP paper.
