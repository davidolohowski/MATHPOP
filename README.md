The MATHPOP project is an `R` software developed to help astrophysicists infer globular cluster counts and their luminosity functions in Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies. This repo contains the source code and various analysis files for the MATHPOP project.

For more details, please see the [MATHPOP][] webpage for a simple tutorial and all `RMarkdown` files to reproduce the results in the original MATHPOP paper.

The `R` package for MATHPOP is not yet available on CRAN, but you can access it through Github in `R` by

```
devtools::install_github('davidolohowski/MATHPOP_R_pkg')
```

The `source/` folder in this repo contains the old version of the source code used to obtain results in the original paper.

For bugs report, trouble-shooting, or questions, please open an [issue][].
