# Old Source Code

Old version of source code used to obtain results in the original MATHPOP paper. It is highly recommended that you use the source code in `code/` folder if you do not have sufficient experience with `R` as it is the optimized for much better user-experience. However, due to the update, the results obtained from the new version of the code will not match exactly with the results from the original MATHPOP paper, but they are entirely consistent.

Only use the code in this folder if you know what you are doing with `R` and want to reproduce the exact results from the original paper.
