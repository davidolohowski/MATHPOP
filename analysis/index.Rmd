## MATHPOP

Welcome to MATHPOP, a `R` software for inferring globular cluster (GC) counts in low-surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) and ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). The `R` code in this repo is written based on the framework of MArk-dependently THinned POint Process (MATHPOP) proposed by Li et al. (2024), "*Discovery of Two Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies with Unusually Bright Globular Cluster Luminosity Functions via a Mark-Dependently Thinned Point Process (MATHPOP)*".

## R and RStudio

`R` is a powerful open source language designed for statistical computing and data analysis. Download `R` at [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [`RStudio`](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). `R` is the base language environment that executes all programs and code. `RStudio` is an integrated user interface wrapper that makes the base `R` easy to use (similar to `Jupyter Notebook` for `Python`). 

### How to use R

If you are an absolute beginner of `R`, there are a LOT of resources and tutorials teaching how to use `R`. The best (in my opinion) resource is the book '*R for Data Science*' by Hadley Wickham, and [here](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) is a free online version of the book.

## Install the MATHPOP R package

To use MATHPOP for your own data, download and install the MATHPOP `R` package by running the following code in `R` console.

```{r, echo = T, eval=F}
devtools::install_github('davidolohowski/MATHPOP_R_pkg')
```

## Quick Start

For a quick example of how to use MATHPOP, see this [vignette](vignette.html).

The MATHPOP framework also proposes to use a probabilistic GC catalog, see this [tutorial](GC_prob.html) on how to obtain a probabilistic GC catalog from point sources.

## MATHPOP Paper Code

This repo also contains various vignettes for the main analysis done in different sections of the Li et al. (2024) paper, and they are all reproducible and accessible in this repo.
